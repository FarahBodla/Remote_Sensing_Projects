## Overview

This repository contains graduate research project reports completed as part of PhD coursework in remote sensing and Earth observation at the University of Colorado Boulder. The projects explore the use of satellite-based GNSS reflectometry and microwave radiometry data for environmental monitoring applications, with a focus on statistical inversion modeling and signal analysis in Matlab.

## Projects

### 1. CYGNSS Data for Wetland Monitoring and Vegetation Height Estimation
Analysis of data from NASA's Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission for flat-water detection and estimation of vegetation cover height. The study defines CYGNSS data products in Delay-Doppler Map coordinates and demonstrates feasibility for wetland identification and monitoring. A three-parameter inversion model based on the Interference Pattern Technique (IPT) is presented, along with a Cramér-Rao bound analysis on achievable temporal resolution.

### 2. Basin-level Water Availability Prediction Using SMAP and Satellite Rainfall Data
Integration of NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite data and satellite-derived rainfall datasets as inputs to a hydrologic model for basin-level water availability estimation. Includes visualization of basin geometry, river inputs and outputs, and groundwater availability using QGIS, with data accessed via NetCDF portals from NASA's OPeNDAP framework.
